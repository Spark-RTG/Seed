A seed that can grow :)
This cell-automata system targets to simulate the learning behavior of groups of units such as the slime bacteria.
It works based on a simple map where 0 stands for barriers and 1 stands for available spaces. 

The main optimization algorithm utilized in this program is inheritance method. Several methods in the system still needs to optimize.

The system is still under development. 2021.6.2

2021.9.1:
The optimization implemented gives statistical confidence that it performs better than simple randomization.
